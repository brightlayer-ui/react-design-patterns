# React Design Patterns

This repository holds the source code for some [PX Blue's design patterns](https://pxblue.github.io/patterns), written in React. 

> NOTE: once this goes public, we will be able to provide deeplinks into each pattern using CodeSandbox.

## Update
To update the code base, first clone the repository and make a feature branch:
```
git clone https://github.com/pxblue/react-design-patterns.git
cd react-design-patterns
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```
Then you may run `yarn && yarn start` to start a local server. 

Once you have made your changes, push your feature branch and make a Pull Request into the dev branch.
